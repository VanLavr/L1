Mutex and RWMutex:
			In Golang, both Mutex and RWMutex are used for synchronization, but they have different characteristics and use cases.

			Mutex:

			Mutex is a mutual exclusion lock that allows only one goroutine to access the shared resource at a time, 
			making it suitable for scenarios where the resource is being exclusively written to or read from.
			It provides the Lock and Unlock methods for exclusive access to the shared resource.
			RWMutex:

			RWMutex is a reader/writer lock that allows multiple readers or a single writer to access the shared resource. 
			This is useful when the resource is read more often than it is written to.
			It provides the RLock, RUnlock, Lock, and Unlock methods, allowing for both shared (read) and exclusive (write) access to the resource.
			The difference between Rlock and Lock in Golang is that:

			Rlock is used to acquire a shared (read) lock with RWMutex, allowing multiple goroutines to read the shared resource concurrently.
			Lock is used to acquire an exclusive (write) lock with both Mutex and RWMutex, allowing only one goroutine to access the shared resource at a time.
			In general, you should use Mutex when the shared resource is mostly being written to or when there are potential race conditions during writes. 
			On the other hand, RWMutex should be used when the shared resource is primarily read and less frequently written to, allowing for concurrent reads without blocking.
